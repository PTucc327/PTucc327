# 👋 Hi, I’m Paul Tuccinardi
### 🎯 About Me

I’m a Master of Data Science student (previously B.S. in Computer Science), passionate about turning data into actionable insights. I build end-to-end data products — from raw data ingestion and cleaning, to analytics, machine learning, and visualization dashboards — and I’m actively seeking full-time roles in Data Science, Machine Learning, or Analytics.
